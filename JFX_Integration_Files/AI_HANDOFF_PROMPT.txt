# AI Handoff Prompt

**Instructions for the User:**
Copy the text below and paste it to the AI agent in your Firebase Studio / JFX Journal workspace.

---

**PROMPT START**

I have a folder called `JFX_Integration_Files` that contains the code to add MT5 EA connectivity to this Next.js app.

**STEP 0: READ THE RULES**
Before doing anything, please read `JFX_Integration_Files/AI_RULES.md`. You must strictly follow the constraints defined there (e.g., do not touch unrelated files, preserve logic).

Here is the plan:

1.  **Backend (API Route):**
    - Take the content of `JFX_Integration_Files/route.ts` and place it in `src/app/api/ea-webhook/route.ts`.
    - Ensure that `firebase-admin` is correctly set up in `src/lib/firebase-admin.ts`. If that file doesn't exist, please create it and initialize the Firebase Admin SDK.

2.  **Frontend (Dashboard Page):**
    - Take the content of `JFX_Integration_Files/page.tsx` and place it in `src/app/(dashboard)/ea-connect/page.tsx`.
    - Check the imports in this file. It imports `db` from `@/lib/firebase` and types from `@/types`. Please ensure these paths match our project structure or adjust the imports accordingly.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - We need `firebase-admin` and `zod` installed. Please check `package.json` and add them if missing.

4.  **Navigation:**
    - Please add a link to the new "EA Connect" page (`/ea-connect`) in the main sidebar navigation so I can access it.

Please execute these steps and let me know when the integration is complete.

**PROMPT END**
